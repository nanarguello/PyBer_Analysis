# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to study all of Pyber’s rideshare data from January to May in order to create a summary DataFrame filtered by city type and then to create a line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type (urban, suburban and rural). 

### Requirements

A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
A written report for the Pyber analysis

Our analysis shows disproportions between the three city types (“Rural”, “Suburban” and “Urban”). Urban areas have more rides, drivers and total fares. The average fare per ride is the lowest of the three city types and so is the average fare per driver.
Rural cities have the lowest total of rides, drivers and fares, however the average fare per ride is the highest just like the average fare per driver.

When reviewing the line chart, we can see that fares are higher between February and March for the three city types. During April, the rides are the lowest in the suburban areas, but they are the highest in rural cities.

## Summary
The following are three business strategies that Pyber could apply in order to address the disparities between the city types:

Increase prices in urban areas with the intention of raising the average fare per driver. 

Boost the rides in the rural areas by lowing the prices or with advertising campaigns.

During the month of April, suburban areas have the lowest amount of rides while the rural areas have the highest total of rides. During this month, Pyber could relocate drivers from Suburban to Rural cities as a means to satisfy the increased demand for ride-sharing.
